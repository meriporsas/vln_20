Welcome to a new space in Vilnius dedicated to Belarusian human rights, community and culture! As a team of local initiatives we represent both old and new Belarusian diasporas in Vilnius.
We are enthusiastic and determined to create a safe and inclusive space for every Belarusian that has suffered from the actions of Belarusian authorities. We strive to create a place for meeting, experience exchange and collaboration between local and newly arrived Belarusians as well as Vilnius residents and Lithuanian citizens.

You can find us in a beautiful building, located on Vilnius str. 20 (court entrance). This building is graciously provided by Vilnius city municipality.

Currently there are four organisations involved in the making of the center:
*Headquarters of a media hub ZUBR.in, a creator of public monitoring projects dedicated to registering cases of 2020 Belarusian Presidential election fraud, court monitoring and reporting on human rights violations in Belarus.

*Belarusian I. Lutskevich museum presents exhibitions on art and heritage, as well as community activities. The museum continues the work of the first-ever Belarusian museum, which opened in Vilnius exactly a century ago in 1921, and continued to work up until 1939 Soviet occupation, when the museum was dismantled and many of its staff faced Stalinist repressions.

*Human rights organisation "Spring" (Viasna) - the most famous Belarusian human rights activists led by currently imprisoned Nobel Peace prize laureate Ales' Bialiatski.

*Public organisation "Doctors for truth and justice" - an organisation of medical personnel that had to flee Belarus because of political repressions. This organisation provides psychological support to Belarusian adults and children.

Every week we have a range of activities for adults and children. Adults in our center:
- learn the Lithuanian language;
- can receive psychological help;
- visit changing art and heritage exhibitions;
- go to folk singing and folk art circles;
- practice their Belarusian language in the lectures of linguist Vincuk Viachorka;
- borrow books from our library;
- write letters to Belarusian political prisoners;
- attend lectures on various topics: from health to human rights to culture;
- go to concerts;
- parents meet in the "Parents School", where they discuss current issues with a psychologist.

Kids meanwhile...
- on Saturdays and Sundays go to the Belarusian school, where they learn the Belarusian language and traditional handicrafts;
- attend a theater studio, where they learn choreography, vocals, and of course, acting;
- learn Lithuanian, English and Polish languages;
- attend the choir, robotics, programming, and art clubs, and watch movies dubbed in Belarusian together;
- read children's books in our library;
- participate in celebrations and events intended specifically for children;
- go to a psychologist, and children with special needs meet in a group of neuroatypical children led by a specialist;
- teenagers attend group therapy.
