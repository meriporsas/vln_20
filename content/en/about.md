Welcome to a new space in Vilnius dedicated to Belarusian human rights, community and culture! As a team of local initiatives we represent both old and new Belarusian diasporas in Vilnius.
We are enthusiastic and determined to create a safe and inclusive space for every Belarusian that has suffered from the actions of Belarusian authorities. We strive to create a
place for meeting, experience exchange and collaboration between local and newly arrived
Belarusians as well as Vilnius residents and Lithuanian citizens.

You can find us in a beautiful building, located on Vilnius str. 20 (court entrance). This building is graciously provided by Vilnius city municipality.

Currently there are four organisations involved in the making of the center:
*Headquarters of Zubr and Malanka Media, an independent Belarusian internet
television news channel, created by Belarusian political refugees. NGO Zubr also is a
creator of public monitoring projects dedicated to registering cases of 2020
Belarusian Presidential election fraud, court monitoring and reporting on human
rights violations in Belarus.
*Belarusian I. Lutskevich museum presents exhibitions on art and heritage, as well as
community activities. The museum continues the work of the first-ever Belarusian
museum, which opened in Vilnius exactly a century ago in 1921, and continued to
work up until 1939 Soviet occupation, when the museum was dismantled and many
of its staff faced Stalinist repressions.
*Charity fund “Razam” aims to provide exiled Belarusians with legal and material
support in order to ease their transition in Lithuania. The fund volunteers provide
Belarusian refugees with temporary housing and humanitarian aid; consult and help
them to find jobs and other necessary institutions; teach basic Lithuanian.
*Public organisation “Pahonia”, a hub for civic and political solidarity projects,
advocacy and support of human rights, culture and heritage projects.
