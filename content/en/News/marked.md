We invite you to support the free political prisoner on the anniversary of her arrest. Asia Bulybenka will transform her experience through painting and performance, which will take place on Tuesday, October 17, the day she was detained. And the exhibition of works will last 10 days - that's how many days Asia spent in confinement. In total, Asia spent two years in prison, but during this performance she will speak about her detention under an administrative article.

We are so glad to present this event - we want to celebrate and to rejoice in the freedom of every former political prisoner. And at the same time, it is clear that the pain and horror of detention does not disappear after release - so it is so important to give space for these feelings and support those who experience them.

We are looking forward to see you at the performance and exhibition.

Everything will take place at Vilniaus str. 20, free admission.
