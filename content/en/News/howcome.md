We open our Community and Culture Center with a serious question from Belarusian I.Lutskevich Museum. The answer lies in the exhibition which consists not only of artistic works and curatorial musings, but also of visitor contributions: artistic ones, angry ones, consoling and everything in between.

{{< figure src="https://vilnia.com/images/fem1.jpg" title="In the exhibition we ask the visitors to become participants: to write their feelings, to polemise, to express themselves on the museum walls." >}}

The exhibition tracks the relationship between Belarusian protests which many has titled a female revolution due to high involvement of women in the oppositional movement, and patriarchy. We feel that patriarchy in Belarus is deeply ingrained not only in the state mechanisms, but as well in the society members regardless of their gender. The exhibition texts ask how come women became a symbol of revolutions worldwide, but not more than that; about their creativity and work; how they fight for their rights and how it sometimes mean that there is less rights left for other women; how the speech creates battlefield where every one of us is present; and what is, after all, the fair gender, or how we say it in Belarusian, the weak gender.
